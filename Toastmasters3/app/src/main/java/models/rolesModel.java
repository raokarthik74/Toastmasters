Speeches are usually designed to meet the requirements of one of the projects in the communication manuals. \"Table topics\" is an extemporaneous speaking exercise where the speaker speaks \"off the cuff\"; that is, the speaker responds to a question or topic that is not known beforehand. The Table Topics Master presents the topic, calls on an individual, and then that individual has 1 to 2 minutes to respond. The evaluation session is where feedback is provided to all members, including the speakers. The evaluation session is headed by a General Evaluator.

                        "People join a Toastmasters club to improve their speaking and leadership skills, and these skills improve through evaluations. Members prepare and present speeches based on projects in the competent communicator manual. You may be asked to serve as an evaluator and evaluate a speaker. In addition to your verbal evaluation, you will give a written evaluation using the guide in the manual. The role of an individual evaluator (For a prepared speech) is something which is probably unique to Toastmasters. Any individual evaluator has the responsibility to pass on the knowledge and skill received from the Toastmaster fraternity to newer members. As an individual evaluator, you hold the key to make anyone a successful speaker. \n" +

                        "It is human to be prejudiced about any topic, might be a positive prejudice or a negative one. But an evaluator must get rid of all personal prejudices. This is because our notions do not allow us to listen to the speaker's ideas with an open mind.\n" +

                        "This also is a kind of prejudice. Some speakers are comfortable with a particular style of speaking depending on various factors. Some are humorous speakers, some inspirational and some are story tellers. Do not let your personal style influence the speaker's style in a deleterious manner. Always evaluate the Speaker's style in the context of the topic chosen. Recommend changes to style only if it is seriously flawed or is out of sync to the emotion the speaker intends to bring out.\n" +

Observe every part of the speaker's demeanor on stage, be it body language or vocal variety or stage usage. The overall confidence level of a speaker depends on the combination of these factors. But the evaluator must definitely not be carried away by these factors alone, but must look into the content and structure of the speech as well. A very good content and structure shows the preparedness, commitment and the confidence of the speaker.\n" +

Suggest rather than preach any criticism that points out serious flaws in one's oratory skills, and do it only in private. A Toastmaster's foremost duty is to encourage others to come on stage and speak. As an evaluator, you have the right to criticize a speaker. So, discharge your duties in a very encouraging manner when it comes to highlighting the good and in a subtle manner when it comes to suggesting improvements. But there is always room to give more critical but inoffensive suggestions in private.\n" +
